# Security considerations

This document outlines the primary security measures and design principles implemented across the SeedSafe protocol, covering smart contracts, Paymaster usage, authentication, and user-side protections.

---

## 1. Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
- The system uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to manage permissions.
- Roles include `ADMIN_ROLE`, `AUDITOR_ROLE`, `PRODUCER_ROLE`, and `MINTER_ROLE`.
- Only authorized contracts or accounts may invoke critical functions.

### Minting Logic
- `TCO2Token.mint()` can only be executed by accounts with `AUDITOR_ROLE`.
- `NFTCombo.mintCombo()` is restricted to `MINTER_ROLE`, assigned exclusively to the `HarvestManager`.
- ERC-1155 harvest tokens are only minted after auditor approval.

### Fund Transfers
- Transfers to producers and the reimbursement fund use low-level `call` with strict return verification.
- 5% platform fee is allocated to the `AgriFinance` fund contract.
- Contracts do not hold idle ETH balances unnecessarily.

### Reentrancy & Overflow Protection
- No external calls are made before updating internal state.
- Solidity version 0.8.x and above is used, providing built-in overflow protections.

---

## 2. Paymaster and Backend Protections

### Paymaster Configuration
- Transactions eligible for sponsorship must be explicitly whitelisted or meet defined criteria.
- Rate limiting and per-user tracking can be enforced at the relayer level.

### API & Authentication (if applicable)
- Authenticated endpoints are protected using `Auth0` with role-based route restrictions.
- Session management uses short-lived JWTs to minimize exposure.

---

## 3. User Protections

### Smart Wallets (Account Abstraction)
- Users interact with ERC-4337 smart contract wallets, reducing the need to manage private keys.
- Wallet creation and recovery are handled by the StackUp SDK using social/email-based login.

### NFT Metadata
- Metadata is embedded on-chain using Base64-encoded JSON.
- No reliance on mutable external metadata services.

## 4. Incident Response

| Risk Area              | Response Strategy                                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Smart contract bug     | Emergency pause (if implemented), upgrade path review      |
| Critical vulnerability | Community disclosure and investor reimbursement via fund  |
| Paymaster abuse        | Suspension of sponsorship and log analysis                |

---

## 5. Testing and Audit Readiness

- All critical functions are covered by automated unit tests.
- Simulated scenarios include failed harvests, partial deliveries, and unauthorized access attempts.
- The system is designed for external audit prior to mainnet deployment.

---

## 6. Compliance Considerations

- TCOâ‚‚ token issuance is restricted to validated and auditable agricultural practices.
- All tokens are issued with traceability and accountability measures.

SeedSafe is built with modular security architecture, rigorous access control, and gas-sponsorship protections to ensure trust, reliability, and resilience across all layers of the system.
