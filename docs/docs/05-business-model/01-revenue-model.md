# Revenue model

## **Introduction**

Seed Safe’s revenue model balances productive inclusion, economic sustainability, and easy access to Web3. The platform operates with affordable fees, a self-guarantee structure via harvests, and includes partner institutions that fund free access for farmers. All of this is enabled through smart contracts and the Paymaster infrastructure on the NERO Chain.

## **Revenue Structure**

### **1. Fee on Crop Token Purchases**

For every crop token purchase, a **5% fee** is applied and distributed as follows:

- **3% to the Seed Safe Paymaster** (gas subsidy)  
- **2% for platform maintenance** (servers, support, technical team)  

This fee is automatic and transparent, applied at the time of transaction without friction for farmers or investors.

### **2. Self-Declared Guarantee Fund**

There is no additional fee for the guarantee fund. Instead, it is built in a **productive** way:

- The farmer declares a planned harvest of, for example, **10,000 kg** of corn.  
- They choose to tokenize **only 9,500 kg**, reserving **5% (500 kg)** as a **guarantee fund**.  
- If the full harvest is reached, the 500 kg are **returned to the farmer** for use or sale.  

This model **protects the investor without unfairly penalizing the farmer**, while avoiding technical or bureaucratic complexity.

### **3. Farmer Boosting Program**

Farmers can apply to receive **institutional support** within the platform:

- Seed Safe connects these farmers with **companies or NGOs** interested in sponsoring their journey.  
- The platform charges a **fixed monthly fee per boosted farmer** (e.g., **$100 to $200 USD**), which includes:
  - Highlighted placement in the UI  
  - Free access to the system (sponsored gas)  
  - Optional custom impact reports  

### **4. Institutional Partnerships & ESG Sponsorships**

Companies, cooperatives, or NGOs can support the platform in exchange for benefits such as:

| Partnership Action                                  | What We Deliver                                                    | Estimated Revenue (USD)        |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Paymaster Funding**                              | Gasless transactions for hundreds of farmers                        | $1,000 to $10,000/month        |
| **Impact Dashboard with Institutional Branding**   | Dashboard with environmental, social, and economic data + logo      | $200 to $2,000/month           |
| **Impact NFTs + ESG Certification**                | NFTs with verified metadata (harvest, carbon, social impact)         | Price on demand                |
| **Custom Compliance Reports**                      | Documentation for ESG, carbon, and inclusion targets                 | $100 to $1,000 per report      |

## **Paymaster Sustainability**

The Seed Safe **Paymaster** ensures users pay no gas when interacting with the blockchain. It is funded through:

- **3% of transaction fees**  
- **Institutional sponsorships**  
- **One-time events (airdrops, impact campaigns)**  

This model enables **true inclusion of smallholder farmers**, while maintaining the fluidity of the Web3 experience and eliminating technical barriers.

## **Conclusion**

Seed Safe’s revenue model combines simplicity, impact, and sustainability. By decentralizing the guarantee fund, lightly monetizing platform usage, and attracting ESG-focused institutions, the solution creates a virtuous cycle of productive inclusion and economic return. All of this with full traceability, on-chain reputation, and accessibility via the NERO Chain Paymaster.
