# Market strategy

# Blue Ocean Analysis - SeedSafe Project

## 1. Introduction to the Blue Ocean Concept

The Blue Ocean Strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, proposes that companies should seek to create new unexplored market spaces (blue oceans) instead of competing in existing saturated markets (red oceans). To achieve this, it is necessary to redefine market boundaries and create an innovative value proposition that makes competition irrelevant.

The SeedSafe project (AgroChain + AgroCarbon) aims to create a blue ocean in the market for tokenization of agricultural harvests and carbon credits, offering an integrated solution for small rural producers that combines access to financing, traceability, and environmental compensation.

## 2. Market Differentiation Analysis

To build the Blue Ocean matrix, we analyzed SeedSafe and its main competitors in relation to attributes relevant to the market. The analysis demonstrates how SeedSafe differentiates itself through the actions of Reduce, Eliminate, Raise, and Create.

### 2.1 Main Competitors Analyzed

We identified the following relevant competitors for SeedSafe:

1. **MOSS**: Brazilian company pioneering the tokenization of carbon credits, which has already allocated more than R$100 million to sustainability projects in the Amazon. Its MCO2 token represents a carbon credit and is traded on various exchanges.

2. **Toucan Protocol**: Framework for creating carbon credits in web3 that connects the voluntary carbon market to cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity to the sector. For each verified credit that enters the platform, a tokenized credit is generated. It operates with two types of products, the Base Carbon Tonne (BCT) and the Nature Carbon Tonne (TCO2).

3. **Pachama**: Technology platform that uses satellite data, drones, and artificial intelligence to identify the best locations for generating carbon credits and monitoring projects to ensure they are actually removing carbon from the atmosphere.

4. **KlimaDAO**: Decentralized organization that generates tokenized carbon credits in the form of the KLIMA token, financially incentivizing emission reduction and rewarding organizations and individuals for their mitigation initiatives.

5. **Sylvera**: Startup that provides independent ratings and analyses of carbon credits, bringing transparency to the market and evaluating the quality of projects.

6. **Agrotoken**: Platform focused on the tokenization of agricultural commodities such as soybeans, corn, and wheat, which function as digital currencies for payments and access to rural financing.

7. **Traditional harvest buying/selling process**: The traditional method of commercialization and financing of agricultural harvests, characterized by high bureaucracy, presence of intermediaries, and lack of traceability.

### 2.2 ERRC Matrix - SeedSafe

The ERRC Matrix (Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create) guides strategic adjustments in SeedSafe's attributes, aligning its value proposition with market needs:

#### ELIMINATE
- **Financing bureaucracy**: SeedSafe eliminates bureaucratic processes through automated smart contracts.
- **Financial intermediaries**: The platform eliminates the need for banks, financial institutions, and other intermediaries through tokenization and direct connection between investors and producers.

#### REDUCE
- **Minimum investment size**: SeedSafe allows extreme fractionation of assets through ERC-1155 tokenization, enabling investments of any value.
- **Technological complexity for the user**: The platform implements a Web2-like gasless experience with Account Abstraction, making blockchain use transparent for the end user.

#### RAISE
- **Transparency and traceability**: All transactions are recorded on blockchain, allowing complete audit and traceability of the harvest from field to plate and the associated carbon credits.
- **Accessibility for small producers**: SeedSafe prioritizes small producers with cost-free onboarding mechanisms and no need for a funded wallet.
- **Liquidity of agricultural assets**: Tokenization allows future harvests and carbon credits to be easily traded in secondary markets.

#### CREATE
- **On-chain reputation system**: An immutable record of producers' history based on past deliveries, creating a mechanism of trust and incentive for contract fulfillment.
- **Carbon credits + harvest integration**: Unique combination of agricultural harvest tokenization with carbon credit generation in a single platform.
- **Loss guarantee fund**: Innovative mechanism that protects investors against partial or total harvest losses.
- **Fee-free (gasless) experience**: Completely gasless system via Paymaster, eliminating financial barriers for small producers to enter.

#### Pachama
- **Strengths**: Advanced use of artificial intelligence, satellite imagery, and Lidar technology for precise monitoring of carbon capture in forest projects. High reliability.
- **Limitations**: Focus on monitoring and verification, without offering integration with agricultural harvests or financing mechanisms for small producers.

#### KlimaDAO
- **Strengths**: DAO model aimed at increasing the price of carbon credits in the market, with a reward system for KLIMA token holders.
- **Limitations**: High volatility and complexity for users unfamiliar with DeFi and staking mechanisms. No focus on small producers.

#### Sylvera
- **Strengths**: Platform specialized in providing independent ratings and analyses of carbon credit projects, increasing market transparency.
- **Limitations**: Acts primarily as an evaluator/certifier and not as a direct trading or tokenization platform.

#### Agrotoken
- **Strengths**: Specialization in the tokenization of agricultural commodities, enabling their use as a means of payment and guarantee for financing.
- **Limitations**: Does not incorporate environmental aspects or carbon credits. Focused on commodities, not on small producers.

## 3. SeedSafe's Blue Ocean Strategy

### 3.1 Value Innovations

SeedSafe creates a blue ocean by:

1. **Integrating agricultural tokenization and carbon credits**: It is the only platform that combines tokenization of future harvests with carbon credit generation, providing two revenue sources for small producers.

2. **Eliminating transaction fees**: With the Account Abstraction (AA) and Paymaster system of the NERO Chain, SeedSafe completely eliminates transaction fees (gas fees), democratizing access to blockchain technology.

3. **Ensuring investor protection**: The innovative guarantee fund protects investors against partial or total harvest losses, creating greater confidence in the system.

4. **Creating an on-chain reputation system**: The immutable record of producers' history creates an unprecedented trust mechanism in the sector.

### 3.2 Reconstructing Market Boundaries

SeedSafe redefines market boundaries by:

1. **Uniting two distinct markets**: Connects the agricultural tokenization market with the carbon credit market, creating unprecedented synergies.

2. **Focusing on small producers**: Directs its technology to a segment generally neglected by existing blockchain solutions.

3. **Transforming challenges into opportunities**: Converts small producers' difficulty in accessing credit into an opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios.

4. **Democratizing access to blockchain technology**: Eliminates technical and financial barriers to adoption, allowing users with no prior knowledge to use the platform.

### 3.3 Implementation Strategy

The implementation of SeedSafe's blue ocean will follow these steps:

1. **Functional MVP**:
   - Producers create Smart Account + tokenize harvest
   - Investors buy fractions of future harvests
   - Cooperatives validate sustainable practices → producers receive TCO₂
   - Proportional delivery system + refund in case of problems
   - Investors receive Combo NFT with ESG metadata

2. **Expansion of Functionalities**:
   - Integration with climate oracles for harvest monitoring
   - On-chain reputation system with delivery history
   - Secondary marketplace for token trading
   - Dashboards for tracking ESG impact

3. **Scale and Partnerships**:
   - Agricultural cooperatives for mass adoption
   - Companies with ESG goals for purchasing carbon credits
   - Financial institutions for secondary market liquidity
