# Tokenomics and economic sustainability

## **Introduction**

&emsp;Tokenization is the core of Seed Safe. The **tokenomics** model was designed to bring together traceability, environmental impact, and economic security in a transparent way. Through three interconnected assets — the **Crop Token (ERC-1155)**, **TCO2 Token (ERC-20)**, and **ComboNFT (ERC-721)** — the system ensures clarity for investors, trust for farmers, and sustainable revenue opportunities for the project.

## **Crop Token – ERC-1155**

&emsp;Each tokenized harvest generates a collection of **fungible tokens**, where each represents **1 kg of an agricultural product**. By default:

- **1 token = 1 kg of a specific crop**  
- Example: 1 rice token (2025 harvest) = 1 kg of physical rice

### **Pricing in USD and Conversion to NERO**

- The farmer sets the **price per kg in USD** (e.g., $0.80/kg).  
- The platform **automatically converts the price to NERO**, using oracles (via Chainlink, RedStone, or NERO Oracle).  
- The investor sees the price **directly in NERO**, simplifying the purchase process.  
> ⚠️ **Note:** currently, USD-to-NERO conversion is done statically at the time of harvest registration, due to MVP limitations.  
> 🚀 In future stages, we plan to integrate a **real-time exchange rate API** or a **decentralized oracle** (such as RedStone or Chainlink) to automate the exchange rate and provide even more accurate pricing for investors.

#### **Example:**

- Price set: **$1.00/kg**  
- Current rate: **1 NERO = $0.10**  
- Final price displayed: **10 NERO/token**

&emsp;This model ensures **fair and stable pricing**, allowing the farmer to keep their crop value pegged to USD while operating on the NERO Chain.

## **TCO2 Token – ERC-20**

&emsp;This token represents the **environmental compensation** generated by agricultural production. The number of TCO2 tokens issued depends on the **area planted**, **type of crop**, and **adopted environmental practices** (e.g., no-till farming, agroforestry, etc.).

### **Simplified Logic:**

- For each verified harvest, auditors calculate the carbon sequestration potential.  
- The value is converted into TCO2 and **minted to the farmer**.  
- These tokens can:
  - Be **sold** on the carbon market  
  - Be **burned** to offset shortfalls  
  - Be **integrated into the impact NFT**

### **Example:**

- 10 hectares of corn using regenerative practices  
- Verification generates **150 TCO2**  
- Farmer receives 150 TCO2 tokens minted directly to their account

## **ComboNFT – ERC-721**

&emsp;After purchasing crop tokens and generating TCO2, the investor receives a **unique NFT** that certifies their **participation in the harvest and the environmental impact generated**.

This NFT includes:

- Amount of tokens purchased  
- Amount of TCO2 generated  
- Crop data (date, farmer, location, crop type)  
- IPFS hash with complete and verifiable metadata

The ComboNFT serves as **proof of impact and traceability**, and can be used for:

- Investor’s on-chain reputation  
- ESG impact reporting  
- Resale in secondary marketplaces  

## **Economic Sustainability of the Model**

### **Integrated Value Cycle:**

1. **Farmer sets crop price in USD**  
2. **Investor buys tokens in NERO**  
3. **A portion goes to the Paymaster (3%) and platform maintenance (2%)**  
4. **Carbon tokens are issued as positive impact**  
5. **Impact NFTs are generated for reputation and value appreciation**  
6. **Platform is sustained through transaction volume and institutional partnerships**

## **Initial Projections**

| Indicator                     | 2025 Estimate (pilot phase)   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Integrated farmers            | 20                            |
| Tokenized crop volume         | +150 tons                     |
| TCO2 generated                | +3,000                        |
| Transaction volume (in NERO)  | +500,000                      |
| Seed Safe revenue (5%)        | 25,000 NERO                   |
| Impact NFTs issued            | +400                          |

## **Conclusion**

&emsp;Seed Safe’s tokenomics model turns agricultural production into a trustworthy, transparent, and measurable-impact digital ecosystem. USD-based pricing protects the farmer; traceable tokens provide investor security; and NFTs with environmental metadata enhance reputation and value. Through this cycle, economic sustainability is achieved while democratizing access to Web3 for real-world producers.
