# Seed Safe

## General Description
&emsp;Seed Safe is a Web3 platform built on the NERO Chain, focused on the tokenization of future harvests and the issuance of carbon credits (TCO₂) for smallholder farmers. It enables farmers to raise funds in advance, while investors acquire fractions of future crops and environmental compensations — with zero transaction fees, thanks to the Account Abstraction (AA) system and NERO’s Paymaster.
