# Development phases

## Introduction

&emsp;Seed Safe follows a phased development strategy aligned with the schedule and criteria of the NERO Chain WaveHack. In this Ideathon stage (Wave 1), our focus is on consolidating the vision, technical architecture, and user flows with clarity and originality â€” laying the groundwork for effective dApp development in the upcoming waves.

&emsp;Our unique value lies in the combination of real-world impact (agricultural traceability + carbon credits), intuitive Web3 experience (via Paymaster + Account Abstraction), and long-term sustainability.

## Phase 1 â€“ Ideation and Architecture (ðŸ’¬ Wave 1 â€“ Ideathon)

**Goal:** to formulate a complete, innovative, and executable proposal, with technical clarity, usability focus, and full alignment with NERO Chain's infrastructure and mission.

### Deliverables:

- Clear proposal aligned with NEROâ€™s Paymaster usage (gasless model + simplified onboarding)  
- Definition of 4 core smart contracts:
  - `HarvestManager.sol` (ERC-1155)  
  - `TCO2Token.sol` (ERC-20)  
  - `NFTCombo.sol` (ERC-721)  
  - `AgriFinance.sol` (guarantee fund logic + Paymaster funding)  
- Full modeling of the user flow with a focus on simplicity, Web2-like UX, and inclusion of Web3 non-natives  
- Value proposition, market analysis, and definition of the target audience  
- Modular technical architecture with a scalability vision  
- Design of crop and carbon tokens with real backing and environmental impact  
- On-chain reputation strategy and compensation based on agricultural performance  
- Paymaster sustainability strategy based on platform transaction fees  
- Documentation explaining:
  - Overview of Account Abstraction integration  
  - Implementation and usage logic of NEROâ€™s Paymaster  
  - Complete flow of gasless transactions  
  - Onboarding process for non-technical users  
- Interface design (wireframes and navigation principles)  
- User journey and personas  
- Accessibility and educational guide for diverse audiences  
- Public GitHub repository with the initial version of the project  
- Test guide and demonstration walkthrough
  - Strategic vision for using NEROâ€™s Paymaster  

## Phase 2 â€“ Functional Prototype (ðŸ”¨ Start of Wave 2 â€“ Building)

**Goal:** to turn the documented vision into a functional dApp, with a front-end integrated to smart contracts, and real transaction execution using AA and the Paymaster.

### Expected Deliverables:
- Navigable MVP with:
  - Listing and purchasing of crop tokens (gasless)  
  - Automatic issuance of NFT certificates  
  - Registration of harvest and loss  
  - Generation and burning of TCO2 credits  
- Integration with NEROâ€™s Paymaster  
- Smart Accounts running through a compatible SDK  
- Interactive interface (React + Tailwind) with learning mode + chatbot  
- Initial public testing with real users  

## Phase 3 â€“ Testing, Expansion, and Impact (Wave 3 and Beyond)

**Goal:** to scale the MVP to reach real users, validate the compensation model through the guarantee fund, and explore new modules like oracles, reputation, and incentives.

### Planned Deliverables:
- Implementation of a guarantee fund with partial refund logic  
- On-chain reputation tracking for producers (e.g., deliveries, losses, sustainability)  
- Carbon emission monitoring by agricultural lot  
- Creation of administrative dashboards for NGOs, investors, and validators  

## Conclusion

&emsp;The development phases of Seed Safe were designed to align technical rigor and social impact with the criteria and milestones of the WaveHack. In the ideathon, we delivered a robust, well-structured vision committed to the real adoption of Web3 through NERO Chain. MVP development begins immediately after this stage, focusing on the consolidation of a functional, intuitive dApp with the potential to continue beyond the hackathon.
