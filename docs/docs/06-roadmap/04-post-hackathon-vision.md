# Post-hackathon vision

## Introduction

&emsp;After WaveHack, Seed Safe will no longer be just a prototype. Our vision is to transform the solution into a living platform, actively used by real farmers, investors, and institutions aligned with sustainable practices. In this phase, the focus is on structuring technical scalability, consolidating partnerships, expanding use cases, and ensuring the platform’s economic self-sustainability — all running natively on the NERO Chain.

## Short- and Medium-Term Vision (Q3–Q4 2025)

### 1. Pilot with Real Farmers

- **Goal**: Run a pilot with 3 to 5 smallholder farmers in Brazil  
- **Actions**:
  - Partnerships with local cooperatives  
  - Assisted onboarding with a focus on chatbot and learning mode  
  - Hands-on tracking of a real crop tokenization process  
  - Direct feedback to improve UX and contract logic  

### 2. Impact and Transparency Dashboard

- **Goal**: Launch a public dashboard with real-time metrics  
- **Indicators**:
  - Volume of crop and TCO2 tokens issued  
  - Number of transactions subsidized via Paymaster  
  - Guarantee fund balance per crop  
  - Farmer rankings based on reputation and sustainability  

### 3. Community Audits and Operational DAO

- **Goal**: Launch an initial DAO model for platform governance  
- **Expected Roles**:
  - Curation of accepted farmers and projects  
  - Verification of sustainable practices  
  - Voting on Paymaster fund releases  
  - Rewards for trusted validators  

## Long-Term Vision (2026+)

### 4. Expansion into Latin America

- Target countries: Argentina, Colombia, and Peru  
- Focus on regions with limited access to credit and strong family farming presence  

### 5. Integration with Real-World Data

- Partnerships with sensor providers, oracles, and satellite imagery services  
- Automated certification of regenerative practices (agriculture + carbon)  

### 6. Infrastructure for Other Verticals

- Seed Safe’s modular architecture will enable:
  - Tokenization of reforestation initiatives  
  - Recycling and ESG certification  
  - Climate and carbon-related applications using the same model (ERC-1155 + ERC-20 + NFT + Paymaster)  

## Ecosystem Sustainability

### Reinvestment via Fees

- A portion of all transaction fees will be redirected to the Paymaster  
- Additional portions will support the guarantee fund and contract maintenance  

### Future Funding

- We will seek:
  - Climate-related grants (e.g., Celo, Toucan, KlimaDAO)  
  - Support from regeneration-focused DAOs  
  - Sponsorships from ESG-aligned companies to cover transaction costs for farmers  

## Conclusion

&emsp;Seed Safe was born with the mission of uniting financial inclusion, traceability, and sustainability for smallholder farmers. After the hackathon, we will begin a real journey with tangible impact, backed by a solid technical stack, accessible user experience, and deep alignment with NERO Chain’s values.
