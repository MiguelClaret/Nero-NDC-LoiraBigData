# Target audience and use cases

SeedSafe is designed to serve a diverse but interconnected set of stakeholders, particularly those engaged in sustainable agriculture, climate action, and regenerative finance.

### 1. Smallholder Farmers
Farmers operating on small to medium scales who often lack access to formal financial services or require alternative funding models. These farmers are key actors in regenerative agriculture and carbon sequestration practices.

**Needs:**
- Crop pre-financing to purchase seeds and equipment  
- Revenue streams from carbon credit monetization  
- Transparent and traceable contracts with investors and buyers  
- Simple onboarding without prior Web3 knowledge  

### 2. Agricultural Cooperatives
Cooperatives that represent multiple smallholder farmers and handle logistics, certification, or product commercialization.

**Needs:**
- Tools to tokenize collective harvests and negotiate better prices  
- Simplified data management across farmers  
- Scalable solutions for accessing climate finance  

### 3. Green Investors / Impact Investors
Individuals or institutions focused on funding climate-positive and socially responsible projects.

**Needs:**
- Transparent proof of impact and regenerative practices  
- Tokenized access to farm-backed or carbon-backed assets  
- Yield opportunities from real-world assets (RWAs)  

### 4. Environmental Certification Agents / Auditors
Professionals or organizations that validate farming practices for carbon credit issuance and sustainability reporting.

**Needs:**
- Auditing dashboards with real-time or periodic access to farmer data  
- Verification logs tied to smart contracts  
- Traceable reporting for certifying regenerative impacts  

### 5. NGOs & Development Agencies
Nonprofits and multilateral organizations working on rural development, food security, and climate justice.

**Needs:**
- Scalable tools to support sustainable agriculture initiatives  
- Transparent reporting for funders and stakeholders  
- Data-driven impact tracking  

## Key Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Crop Pre-Financing via Tokenization

**Context:** A farmer wants to plant a new crop season but lacks capital.  
**Solution:**  
- Registers on SeedSafe using smart account (no wallet needed)  
- Submits crop details: expected yield, planting date, practices used  
- A token representing this crop is minted and offered to green investors  
- Investors purchase the token, unlocking funding for the farmer  
- Harvest proceeds are later used to redeem or pay back the investment  

### Use Case 2: Carbon Credit Monetization

**Context:** A farmer adopts regenerative practices like agroforestry or no-till farming.  
**Solution:**  
- Registers environmental actions through SeedSafe dashboard  
- Certification agent verifies and uploads validation reports  
- Carbon credit tokens are issued based on CO2 equivalent  
- These tokens can be sold on the SeedSafe marketplace or other carbon registries  

### Use Case 3: Gasless Web3 Onboarding

**Context:** A rural farmer is not crypto-native and cannot pay for gas.  
**Solution:**  
- Account is created using AA infrastructure (Smart Account)  
- Paymaster sponsors all onboarding and submission actions  
- Farmer interacts through a clean UI/UX, unaware of blockchain complexity  

### Use Case 4: Investor Yield from Sustainable Assets

**Context:** A climate-focused investor wants returns from regenerative projects.  
**Solution:**  
- Buys crop tokens (which are later redeemed for yields)  
- Or purchases carbon tokens to resell or retire (offset)  
- Investor dashboard offers live insights into farming performance and auditing status  

### Use Case 5: NGO Deployment in Agricultural Communities

**Context:** An NGO wants to introduce SeedSafe in multiple rural communities.  
**Solution:**  
- Uses the platformâ€™s cooperative management module  
- Onboards farmers, supports data collection  
- Tracks environmental and economic impact for funder reports  

## Why These Audiences Matter

Each group plays a vital role in unlocking the value of regenerative agriculture:

- **Farmers** create the regenerative value  
- **Auditors** ensure that value is real and verifiable  
- **Investors** unlock financial liquidity to scale that value  
- **NGOs and Cooperatives** bridge technological and educational gaps  

SeedSafe acts as a connective layer to empower, verify, and monetize sustainable farming practices.

## Inclusive Design Strategy

To ensure adoption across all these groups, SeedSafe was built with:

- **Progressive onboarding**: Web2-style interface with optional wallet connection  
- **Local-first features**: Compatible with offline data entry for rural areas  
- **Modular dashboards**: Custom views for farmers, investors, and verifiers  
- **Smart Accounts + Paymaster**: Invisible Web3 for users with no blockchain background  

## Conclusion

SeedSafe addresses the financial, environmental, and usability barriers that currently limit the scalability of regenerative agriculture. By designing for this specific target audience and their daily challenges, we position SeedSafe as a high-impact solution for real-world climate and economic transformation.
