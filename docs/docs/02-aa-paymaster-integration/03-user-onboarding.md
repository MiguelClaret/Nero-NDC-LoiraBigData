# Onboarding process for non-technical users

## Introduction

&emsp;Seed Safe is a Web3 platform designed to be accessible to anyone — including farmers, investors, and communities that have never used blockchain. For that reason, the onboarding process was designed to be **intuitive, guided, and educational**, enabling first-time users to feel safe and empowered to take action within the ecosystem.

## Onboarding Goals

- Welcome users with no Web3 experience with empathy and clarity  
- Guide their first usage in a contextual, non-overwhelming way  
- Build a basic understanding of blockchain, tokens, and certificates  
- Deliver a smooth experience similar to Web2 applications  

## Strategy

&emsp;Seed Safe uses Account Abstraction (AA) with NERO Chain’s Paymaster, which enables:

- Automatic wallet creation (Smart Accounts)  
- Gasless transactions (true gasless model)  
- No need for browser extensions or token balance  
- Simple, visual, and responsive interface across all devices  

## Onboarding Steps

### 1. Initial Access

- The user accesses the platform directly via browser (mobile or desktop)  
- No wallet is required  
- A button is shown:  
  **“Get started – no wallet or balance needed”**

### 2. Automatic Smart Account Creation

- Upon clicking, the system generates a Smart Account linked to the browser, email, or social login  
- The user can immediately perform real actions — such as viewing crops or making a first purchase

### 3. First Gasless Interaction

- The first purchase or action is sent as a `UserOperation`  
- NERO’s Paymaster covers the gas  
- The interface confirms with a friendly message:  
  > “Transaction successful. And the best part: you didn’t pay any fees!”

## Accessible Documentation Before Account Creation

&emsp;Even before creating an account, the platform will provide a **dedicated section explaining how the system works** and introducing fundamental Web3 concepts. This introductory documentation will be available in the main menu under the title:

> **“How does Seed Safe work?”**

&emsp;This section will help users understand:

- What blockchain is and why it’s used  
- What crop tokens, NFTs, and carbon credits are  
- What “gasless transaction” and “Smart Account” mean  
- How reputation, guarantee funds, and environmental impact work  
- How the platform ensures security even without a traditional wallet  

&emsp;The goal is to **offer clarity and transparency from the very first contact**, building trust and explaining the platform’s logic in an accessible and objective way.

## Interactive Learning Mode

&emsp;While using the platform, Seed Safe offers a **lightweight, guided, and contextual learning mode**, activated by default on the first visit.

- Topics explained visually:
  - What is a tokenized crop?
  - How does my account work without MetaMask?
  - Why didn’t I pay a transaction fee?
- Informational balloons, clickable cards, and quick-tip icons  
- “Learn More” option with links to documentation  
- Interface adapts to the user’s knowledge level  

## Integrated Educational Chatbot

&emsp;To complement the onboarding journey, Seed Safe will feature an **intelligent chatbot** that acts as a virtual assistant and answers common questions like:

- **“Do I need money to use the platform?”**  
  > “No! Seed Safe covers the costs for you.”

- **“Is this token money? Is it safe?”**  
  > “This token represents a real portion of a crop, with traceability and guarantees.”

- **“What if I make a mistake or don’t understand something?”**  
  > “I’m here to help. You can ask me anything!”

## UX Designed for Beginners

- **Mobile-first** design, with large buttons and accessible language  
- Avoids technical terms like “ERC-20” or “block explorer”  
- Emphasis on common actions: “Buy crop,” “View my wallet,” “Receive certificate”  
- Clear visual feedback after each successful transaction  

##  Conclusion

&emsp;Seed Safe’s onboarding journey is designed to build trust, clarity, and smoothness from the very first interaction. With accessible documentation available upfront, a built-in learning mode, and chatbot support, the platform ensures that anyone — even without any prior Web3 knowledge — can join the ecosystem, perform transactions, and understand the positive impact of their participation.
