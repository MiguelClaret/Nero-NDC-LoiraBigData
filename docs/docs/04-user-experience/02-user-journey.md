# User Journey
## Concept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Nielsen Norman Group, a user journey is defined as a sequence of steps to accomplish a larger task through a service or product, usually across channels at different times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utility of this process lies precisely in this mapping, which facilitates understanding the reality of users to create resources that facilitate their interaction with the platform or product, in this case, the crop tokenization system (SeedSafe).
