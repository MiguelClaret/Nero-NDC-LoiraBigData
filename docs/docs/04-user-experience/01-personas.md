# Personas

## Concept

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section, we present the main personas created to represent the actors involved in the **SeedSafe** ecosystem. The term persona refers to a character representing a specific social and professional type and, in this case, the target audience.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main personas are João Silva, Giovana Costa, and Dr. Carlos Mendes. The focus was to select people who are in the context of sustainable agriculture, investments with socioenvironmental impact, and technical auditing, and who directly participate in the chain of crop tokenization and carbon credits. Below, we describe these users' activities and the aspects considered for the Web3 system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is the persona representing rural producers in the project context:

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Figure 1: Persona João Silva - Organic Coffee Producer</p>
<div style={{margin: 15}}>
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img src={require("../../static/img/persona_joao.png").default} style={{width: 800}} alt="description of João's persona" />
        <br />
    </div>
</div>
<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Source: Produced by the Authors (2025).</p>



| **Behaviors** | **Needs** | **Pains** |
|---|---|---|
| Grows organic coffee using sustainable practices inherited from his father. | Access to affordable financing to invest in crops. | Traditional banks demand guarantees he cannot offer. |
| Manages his 3-hectare property with limited resources. | Purchase of inputs at the beginning of the production cycle. | Interest rates are prohibitive for his financial reality. |
| Seeks ways to improve productivity without abandoning organic practices. | Adequate valuation of quality organic coffee. | Has little knowledge of digital technology. |
| | Simple and intuitive technological interface. | Difficulty understanding how crop tokenization works. |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This table summarizes the points related to the activities, needs, and challenges faced by the producer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is the persona representing investors in the project:

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Figure 2: Persona Giovana Costa - Investor</p>

        <br />

| **Behaviors** | **Needs** | **Pains** |
|---|---|---|
| Researches investments with positive socioenvironmental impact. | Portfolio diversification with real assets. | Difficulty finding investments with lower volatility. |
| Analyzes the history and potential of each opportunity. | Transparency and traceability in investments. | Lack of options that combine financial return and positive impact. |
| Monitors the development of projects she invests in. | Proof of positive impact of her applications. | Complexity in verifying the implementation of sustainable practices. |
| | Financial return compatible with the market. | Specific risks in the agricultural sector that she needs to learn to manage. |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is the persona representing auditors in the ecosystem:

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Figure 3: Persona Dr. Carlos Mendes - Auditor</p>
<div style={{margin: 15}}>
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img src={require("../../static/img/persona_carlos.png").default} style={{width: 800}} alt="description of Carlos's persona" />
        <br />
    </div>

| **Behaviors** | **Needs** | **Pains** |
|---|---|---|
| Conducts technical assessments of agricultural properties. | Objective criteria for crop evaluation. | Challenge in assessing the productive potential of different properties. |
| Documents analyses and recommendations. | Immutable and auditable records of his analyses. | Difficulty in quantifying the potential for carbon credits. |
| Stays updated on sustainable cultivation practices. | Tools for quantification of carbon sequestration. | Concern with the integrity of the tokenization process. |
| | Reliable system to validate documentation and practices. | Responsibility to maintain the credibility of the system. |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these personas, the project will be structured considering the needs and pains of each actor, seeking solutions that facilitate the process of tokenizing crops and carbon credits, promote sustainable practices, and provide financial returns for all involved.
